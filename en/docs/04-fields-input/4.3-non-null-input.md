### <a name="rule-4.3"></a> 4.3. Mark arguments as `required`, is they are required for query execution.

All fields in GraphQL are `nullable` by default. Hence it's a good practice to mark arguments required for query execution with `GraphQLNonNull` or in case of SDL with exclamation mark â€“ `String!`. This allows to find defect on the client before runtime at the stage of static analysis.

In addition if you defined argument as required you may be sure for it presence in your resolve-method and there is no need to double check it. Because at the parsing and validation stage of your query GraphQL will do that check by itself and will fail query with exception if value is not present. 

For example, to get list of articles consumer have to specify amount of returning records:

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(limit: Int!): [Article]
}
```

But sometimes you shouldn't be so strict and you may define default value for the argument:

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(limit: Int! = 10): [Article]
}
```

In this case consumer may not pass value for the required argument `limit`, it will be 10 by default. But I consumer will try to full your server and pass null in the request - `query { articles(limit: null) }`, server will throw an error `Expected type Int!, found null.`.

In general required arguments in GraphQL works good and you should use it to define your GraphQL schema in stricter way.
