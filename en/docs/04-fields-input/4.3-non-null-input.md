### <a name="rule-4.3"></a> 4.3. Mark arguments as `required` if they are required to fulfill the request.

All fields in GraphQL are `nullable` by default. Hence it's a good practice to mark arguments required for query execution with `GraphQLNonNull` or in case of SDL with exclamation mark â€“ `String!`. This will allow detecting certain errors on the client at static analysis stage instead of a runtime stage.

In addition, if an argument is defined as required a resolve function on the server might not need to check for its presence. GraphQL will do the parsing and validation steps before the resolver's code is executed. The query will fail with an exception if the required argument is missing before it reaches the resolver function. 

For example, to get a list of articles a consumer has to specify the number of records to return:

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(limit: Int!): [Article]
}
```

You can specify the default value for the argument:

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(limit: Int! = 10): [Article]
}
```

In this case, even though an argument is required it can be omitted by the consumer while the backend gets its required argument set to 10. But I consumer will try to full your server and pass null in the request - `query { articles(limit: null) }`, server will throw an error `Expected type Int!, found null.`.

In general required arguments in GraphQL works good and you should use it to define your GraphQL schema in stricter way.
