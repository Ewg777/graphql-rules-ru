### <a name="rule-4.1"></a> 4.1. Group coupled arguments to the new input-type.

Very often there are cases when some arguments are logically coupled. For example you return list of articles `[Article]` with possibility to filter that list using `lang`, `userId`, `rating` fields and limiting output using `limit` field. It's bad to mix those fields on the same level:

- it would be hard for user to understand responsibility of each argument
- in the future you might encounter issues when argument already in use.

You can group coupled arguments, eg. all filter arguments may be put into `filter` argument of `ArticleFilter` type:

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(filter: ArticleFilter, limit: Int): [Article]
}

input ArticleFilter {
  lang: Stirng
  userId: Int
  rating: MinMaxInput
}

input MinMaxInput {
  min: Int
  max: Int
}
```

In the code above you may notice how we did filtering by `rating` field. Instead of two separate arguments `ratingMin` and `ratingMax`, new input-type `MinMaxInput` was introduced.

Nevertheless grouping of coupled fields into sub-type makes schema easier to understand and more scalable in the future.
