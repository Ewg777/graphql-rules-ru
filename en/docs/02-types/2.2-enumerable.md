### <a name="rule-2.2"></a> 2.2. Use Enum for fields that contains fixed set of values.

Quite often schemas includes fields that contains certain set of values. For example `gender`, `order status`, `country code`, `payment type`. Using just `String` or `Int` types don't help your users to understand what values may be received.

Of course you can describe possible values into schema documentation. But that doesn't make sense when GraphQL has type `Enum` â€” [read more](../types/README.md#enumeration-types).

Values of `Enum` type fields are checked at the validation step. They might be checked in development using linters and static analyzers as well. This is the way more profitable and secure than enumerate values in the documentation.

```diff
type User {
-  status: String # BAD
+  status: StatusEnum # GOOD
}

+ enum StatusEnum {
+   ACTIVE
+   PENDING
+   REJECTED
+ }
```
