### <a name="rule-2.2"></a> 2.2. Use Enum for fields that contain a fixed set of values.

A lot of times schemas include fields that represent a finite set of values. For example `gender`, `order status`, `country code`, `payment type`. Using a `String` or `Int` types doesn't help your consumers to understand which values may be received.

Of course, you can enumerate possible values in schema documentation but this is not advisable since GraphQL has a type `Enum` â€” [read more](../types/README.md#enumeration-types).

Incoming values of `Enum` type are checked during the query validation step. They can also be checked during development with the help of linters and static analyzers. This is the way more profitable and secure than enumerate values in the documentation.

```diff
type User {
-  status: String # BAD
+  status: StatusEnum # GOOD
}

+ enum StatusEnum {
+   ACTIVE
+   PENDING
+   REJECTED
+ }
```
