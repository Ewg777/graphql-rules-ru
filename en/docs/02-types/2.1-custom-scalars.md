### <a name="rule-2.1"></a> 2.1. Use custom scalar types in case you want to declare fields or args with semantic value.

If some field returns `String` your clients doesn't have any chance to understand whether this field has any semantic value or not. For instance, with `String` you can send plain text, HTML, 255 chars string, base64 string or even more tricky ones.

To make your API more clear for the team you should use custom scalar types. Examples: `HTML`, `String255`, `Base64`, `DateString`.

This allows back-end developers to write validation, serialization, deserialization for custom scalar types once and avoid duplication code in resolvers.

For front-end developers, it could be useful to write components to represent data and reuse them for specific scalar types.

```diff
type Article {
  id: ID!
-  description: String
+  description: HTML
}
```

In this case, it's easier to understand that `description` field has HTML-format and we don't need to escape it in the browser.
