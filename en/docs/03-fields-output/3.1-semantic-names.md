### <a name="rule-3.1"></a> 3.1. Give descriptive names to fields.

The rule goes without saying. Field names should communicate domain-specific meaning and not the implementation details. Это очень простое и банальное правило. Consider the following type:

```diff
type Meeting {
-  body_html: String # BAD
+  description: HTML # GOOD
}
```

Whoever sees the type `Meeting` for the first time will be guessing what is exactly stored in the `bodyHtml` field. It's great if the backend developers are not lazy and leave a description to the fields. But hell, you can name the field as `description` in the API and name the field as `bodyHtml` in the database, then everything will be clear without documentation.

Often in databases and models there is a mess in the naming, so that [to be not ashamed in front of Don Pedro](https://pikabu.ru/story/anekdot_3660462) - in API, you can map the fields with beautiful and intelligible names.
