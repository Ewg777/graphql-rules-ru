### <a name="rule-5.3"></a> 5.3 Use `limit` with default value and `skip` to limit number of returned items in list.

There is a simple solution to limit number of items in list. Use arguments called `limit` and `skip`. It's a good taste to have default value for "limit". Use Non-Null constraint for `limit` to avoid `null` passed as argument value.

```graphql
type Query {
  articles(
    limit: Int! = 20
    skip: Int
  ): [Article]
}
```
