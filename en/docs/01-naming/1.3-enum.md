### <a name="rule-1.3"></a> 1.3. Name ENUM-types in `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES` fashion.

In GraphQL enum represents a list of available values for specific type.

```diff
enum Sort {
+  NAME_ASC # GOOD
-  nameAsc # BAD
-  NameAsc # BAD
   NAME_DESC
   AGE_ASC
   AGE_DESC
}
```

For example GraphQL uses `__TypeKind` enum with values `SCALAR`, `OBJECT`, `INPUT_OBJECT`, `NON_NULL` etc while doing Introspection queris. As we can see `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES` is being used for enum types.

Considering enum types as a set of names constants almost all programming languages use `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES` to define constant values.

Naming enums in `CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES` style makes it easy to figure them out in GraphQL queries:

```graphql
query {
  findUser(sort: ID_DESC) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
